# Lesson 1

Docker basics.

## Task

1. Create a minimal service that meets the requirements:

   1. Service responds on port 8000;
   2. The service has an HTTP method **GET /health/** with a response:

       ```json
       {
         "status": "OK"
       }
       ```

2. Wrap the application in a docker image and push it to **[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/)**.

### Provide output:

1. Repository name and tag on **[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/)**;
2. Link to [GitHub](https://github.com/) with Dockerfile.
